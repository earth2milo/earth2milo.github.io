<p> In John Berger's Ways of Seeing, Berger reflects on the ever-changing value of art, of one's own body, who we choose to remember in history thanks to art, and the ironies of modern advertising and information. The way in which he chooses to portray the advent of modern television and its effect on art and culture continues to be relevant today. John Berger emphasizes using sight and vision as a tool for change and revealing historical patterns of inequality and injustice throughout culture and art as a whole. He puts into perspective the importance of art in our daily lives, from advertisements, to the portrayal of our bodies and self-esteem. <br> The arguments made by Berger that were especially poignant to me were the senselessness and loss of empathy within modern media, and how the combined rise of modern media and modern advertising has largely propelled an apathetic view of the world onto all who consume media. Advertisements, sensationalism and the need to appeal to every common denomitator has largely evolved every aspect of art and the manner in which we live. This hits espeically close to home today, because in our day and age it seems like every most pieces of media is posted with ulterior motives, as a product placement, a scheme or a way to gather a user's data. It can largely be described as the feeling of being used and sold when browsing the internet. There is a complete lack of disconnect between what is real and what is not real, and that becomes the grey space I find myself in when using the internet. <br> I also appreciate the time and thoughtfull John Berger took to discuss and let viewers think when he would bring up his thoughts. His series is not a constant bombardment of information, of indictment, or controversy. The simple fact that he lets silence grow within his program exemplifies the thought put into letting the viewer have a say in their own thoughts when consuming media. <br> Overall, I enjoyed watching John Berger's Ways Of Seeing, it kept my attention and stayed in my mind after the episodes ended, and I consider it a visionary piece of television and art that is extremely reflective of our current day and age.
